            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>t is a very dark and lonely area and seems
            to be located starboard of the Maw in the
            lowest compartments. Various cabins are
            connected by vent shafts or thick metallic
            doors that Six cannot open. The Prison also
            gives Six her first glimpse of the Janitor but
            the most frequent antagonists encountered
            here are the Leeches and the Eyes. There are
            very little encounters with other beings and
            Six spends the majority of her time in the
            </p>

            The name "The Prison" implies that the
            children are being held there as unwilling
            'guests'. The Janitor seems to be their
            caretaker and keeps them in line. They
            even have a play area, but are prohibited
            from escaping by electric bars on both
            sides. Six also sees a cafeteria where another
            human gives her a piece of bread to subside
            her hunger.

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Upon waking up, Six must head immediately towards the
            right, at the end of the corridor she’ll find a vent that she
            can open and through. Once through, she can climb the
            stairway and crouch through the small opening in the boarded up door.
            </p>

            <p>To get through the next room, Six must jump onto the
            cardboard box, then the bed to reach the small window. In
            the room with the hanging man, the next door’s doorknob
            is too high for Six to reach so she must drag the wooden
            chair to get higher.

            door which will then act as a makeshift
            ladder to reach the top of the wooden
            structure. After climbing to the top of the
            wooden structure, Six must run along its
            roof and jump over the gap while avoiding
            the leeches that will drop from the pipes
            above. She will then reach a small chamber
            with a lever that must be pulled down to
            open the next door. Jumping over a gap will
            bring her to a boarded up door, but the
            bottom board can be removed, providing a

            be most important in the game. While
            pursuing a Nome, she will fall through some
            weakened floorboards into a dark chamber
            filled with black goo and Leeches. Six must
            continue right and avoid the creatures until
            she reaches a wooden door that will give way
            with one push. This will grant her access to a
            large chamber filled with wooden walkways and ladders.
