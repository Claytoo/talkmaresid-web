Hence the name, the Guests will be the primarily antagonists found here, although one of One of the Chefs will also give chase briefly. This area is briefly seen during The Residence chapter after the Runaway Kid is turned into a Nome. </p>

At the end, a conveniently placed ladder will bring her towards porthole and the sound of seagulls. As she walks into the light, Six will be surrounded on all sides by ocean. Diving in the water would mean certain death, so she must jump onto the anchor's chain and climb up. Along the way, she'll notice that the Maw is taking in new passengers, ferried aboard via a walkway.</p>

                <p>Immediately, Six will fall down a shaft but will recover quickly. To continue to the left, she must first remove a wooden plank which will let her crawl into a circular vent. Once through, she must carefully walk along a metal pipe (one false step will send her plummeting down a chasm) which will lead her to the pagoda-style entrance of the restaurant. Six must climb the wooden framework of the entrance to reach a window that will bring her inside. </p>

By slipping through a partly open sliding door, Six will find herself in a room with giant meals laid across wooden tables. Through the next doorway, there will be a Guest feasting upon large pieces of meat. He will pay no mind to Six so she can safely cross the room.</p>
