                    <p>Six needs to climb up the stairs all the way to the top and through the window into a bedroom. 
                    By dragging a briefcase close enough, 
                    she will be able to grab a lever to the right which will reveal a murphy bed. 
                    Climbing it will allow her to reach and climb the dresser drawers and then onto the highest shelf.
                    To safely land on the desk where a key is resting, she has to first jump on the next closest dresser, 
                    then onto the desk. She can then toss the key onto the ground and 
                    jump onto the bed before getting back to ground level. 
                    Six must then grab the key and push her way through the secret door cut in the wall. 
                    From there she'll find a locked door. 
                    Six cannot jump while holding a key so she must first throw it onto the step and then climb up herself. 
                    She can then unlock the padlock and proceed to the next room..</p>

                    If she keeps walking she'll eventually feed on a piece of meat in a cage.

                    Six will enter a room filled with rolls of burlap.

                    placing them on hooks to be sent to the Kitchen. The floorboards will creak if Six steps on them, 
                    alerting the Janitor of her presence, but some of the burlap has been 
                    laid out on the floor which will absorb her footsteps. Six can sneak towards the burlap lying next to the cages. 
                    This will require walking on the floorboards which will alert the Janitor, 
                    but as long as Six makes no additional sounds, she can keep walking and hide in the open cage.</p>
